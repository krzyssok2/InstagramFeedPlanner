        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>Am I affiliated with Instagram?</summary>
            <p>No. Instagram Feed Planner is not affiliated with Instagram, and no logos or trademarks are used beyond fair use for reference purposes.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Is it free? What's the catch?</summary>
            <p>Yep, 100% free! The “catch”? There isn’t one. No subscriptions, no ads, no paywalls. If you like it, a small donation helps keep this project and my other projects alive and growing!</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Where is my data saved?</summary>
            <p>Your planner data is stored locally in your browser. If you clear your cache, it will be lost. No images are uploaded to any server, everything stays strictly isolated in your browser.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Mobile - why did my post buttons disappear after adjusting?</summary>
            <p>For best previewing experience, buttons are hidden until you click on the post.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why does the planner use a 4:3 aspect ratio?</summary>
            <p>When this planner was created, Instagram switched to a 4:3 aspect ratio in the feed. Today you can still upload 1:1 or 4:5 images, but Instagram adjusts them to 4:3 when displaying your grid.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I export or back up my planner?</summary>
            <p>As of now no export feature is planned.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I use this on my phone?</summary>
            <p>Yes, it works on phones, but I recommend using desktop. Mobile browsers limit local storage more strictly, which can sometimes make the experience less reliable. Additionally multi feed functionality is restricted to bigger screens</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do I need an Instagram account to use the planner?</summary>
            <p>Nope! The planner doesn’t connect to Instagram. It’s just a sandbox for you to preview and plan your feed.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I plan more than one feed?</summary>
            <p>To some degree yes, but this functionality is restricted to desktop or phones with bigger screens.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why don’t my images look as sharp as the originals?</summary>
            <p>To keep things fast, your images are compressed and saved to local storage for quick access. Original files are not touched.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Does this post to Instagram for me?</summary>
            <p>No, this tool is only for planning. You’ll still need to upload your posts manually to Instagram.</p>
